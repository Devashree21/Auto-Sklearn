# Auto-Sklearn

Auto-Sklearn: Accelerate your machine learning project with AutoML tool

Here is a short FAQ about this repository

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are going to use an AutoML tool 'Auto-Sklearn' for classification and regression task. The jupyter notebook (.ipynb) provides the code and this readme contains all the relevant information about this tutorial.

**2) What is Auto-Sklearn?**

Auto-Sklearn is a Python-based open-source toolkit for doing AutoML. It employs the well-known Scikit-Learn machine learning package for data processing and machine learning algorithms.

**3) Which dataset has been used?**

For classification task - Heart disease prediction dataset available on the UCI repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). We will use the .csv version available on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
For regression task - 'flights' dataset from seaborn datasets library.
